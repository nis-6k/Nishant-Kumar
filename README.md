# Nishant-Kumar
Hi, I’m Nishant, currently pursuing an MS in Information Systems at Northeastern University (2024-26), with a focus on data science. I specialize in Python, MySQL, neural networks, and data visualization. My experience includes leading data-driven transformations at KPMG, Vector Consulting, and Larsen & Toubro, where I received the "Rising Star" award. I'm passionate about leveraging data to optimize workflows and improve efficiency, and I hold a PMP certification along with agile project management expertise.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, swimming, hiking, playing ping pong, gardening, traveling, watching TV series, and savoring good coffee. I’m actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in data science!
